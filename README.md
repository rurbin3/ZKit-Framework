A lightweight framework written in pure python for payload generation and dosing. ZKit-Framework includes rootkits, ransomware, file transfers, and keyloggers. Both TCP and UDP are available for transfering data. Keylogger uses email for transferring key strokes.
ZKit also helps you to generate your own payloads. **Or in a nutshell Everything a hacker needs.**

## Features

- Support for making malware for a specific target. (With User-Payloads)

- Several methods for encrypting malware and inserting a decode stub for decryption in runtime.

- Special methods for hiding malware from user in Windows and Linux.

- Easy of use . everything works with menus . no arguments

- Payloads available to install in ZKit-Market.

- Building you own payload and publishing it. [Tutorial](https://github.com/000Zer000/ZKit-Framework/wiki/Creating-My-Own-Payload)

- Run DOS attacks.

- Build rootkit reverse shells for Both TCP and UDP.

- Build file transfer payloads (reverse shell rootkit features also included) for both TCP and UDP.

- Build ransomware for TCP and UDP.

- Build keyLoggers for TCP and UDP and also transfer logs by email.

- Payloads use random variable names and whitespaces to fool the AVs. Virus total scan result is: 0/59.

- Auto-updates and notifications about new releases.

To update, go to the root directory of zkit, and run: 

```bash
